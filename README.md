# whichPill

Which Pill is a game about making choices.

Imagine you're selected to participate a military experiment. You're given two pills each day.

The red pill will increase your strength a little bit, but stable.

The blue pill will increase your strenth dramatically, but will possiblly backfire.

After 6 days, there'll be one and only one soldier gets selected to participate next round. If you're not the strongest, you're a failed guinea pig and will get destroyed.

Which pill will you select?
